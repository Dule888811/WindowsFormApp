 
			Done by task https://github.com/Dule888811/WindowsFormApp/blob/master/ApexSQL%20Software%20developer%20evaluation.pdf. 
			In the texbox below the button enter the part of the string you are searching for, click on the buuton and select the place you are looking for on the hard disk.
                        The results are displayed in a listbox, below each result is the number of string repetitions in that document. Documents are limited to text and double-clicking 
                        on the result document opens the document. Texbox above buuton serves me as an auxiliary part of the application, does not mean useless.
